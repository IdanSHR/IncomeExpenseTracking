## Extendable to Front-end Applications 🔄

The Revenue Expense Tracking Bot is primarily a back-end service built to be robust, flexible, and extendable. This allows anyone to create a front-end application that can communicate with this server. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, a front-end interface isn't provided out-of-the-box. Developers and enthusiasts are wholeheartedly invited to bring their creativity and ingenuity to construct a front-end that makes the most out of this bot's features.
